When the mathematical relation of one quantity with the other quantity is find out, then it is said to be regression.

For example: in a survey, we collect data where 5 student say they study for x hours and get y marks like: 

    Hours of stdy |   marks
        4         |    45
        3         |    33
        1         |    22
        8         |    13
        10        |    45


Now here based on these data, Hours of study vs Marks plot will be plotted. 

Since these is not predictable pattern depending on which a mathematical relation is made, like non deterministic(Random) waveform, Linear regression mitigates this problem and derive a mathematical relation and plot a graph of straight line of form :
                        y = mx+c -------(i), where 
                        m = slope of the line 
                        c = y intercept(the point at which a line or curve intersects the y-axis on a graph)
            
            for eg: marks = (slope*hours) + constant
